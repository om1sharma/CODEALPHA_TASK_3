# CODEALPHA_TASK_3
This project uses a CRNN model trained on MNIST and EMNIST datasets to recognize handwritten digits (0–9) and letters (A–Z). It combines CNNs for feature extraction and LSTMs for sequence learning. The system supports character and word prediction, ideal for OCR and handwriting recognition.
